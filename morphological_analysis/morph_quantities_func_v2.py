    Parameters
    ----------
    matrix : 2D numpy matrix
        DESCRIPTION.

    Returns
    -------
    Volumes are calculated as different sum of the cells values so they appear
    as a length. To obtain the "real" volume, the length values must be multiply
    by the cell dimension as: V=tot_vol*dim_x*dim_y
    tot_vol : real
        Total net volume as the algebric sum of all the cells [L]
    sum_vol : real
        Sum of scour and deposition volume as algebric sum of the abs of each cell [L]
    dep_vol : real
        Deposition volume as the sum of the value of deposition cell  [L]
    sco_vol : real
        Scour volume as the sum of the value of scour cell [L]
        
    Active area array is calculated as the number of DoD active cell.
    morph_act_area : integer
        Active area both in terms of scour and deposition in number of cells [-]
    morph_act_area_dep : integer
        Active deposition area in number of cells [-]
    morph_act_area_sco : integer
        Active scour area in number of cells [-]
        
    The active width is calculated as the active area divided by the DoD length
    in terms of number of cells. So the active width is given in number of cell
    and to obtain the width dimension the data need to be multiply by dim_y
    act_width_mean : real
        Total mean active width in number of cells [-]
    act_width_mean_dep : real
        Deposition mean active width in number of cells [-]
    act_width_mean_sco : real
        Scour mean active width in number of cells [-]
        
    act_thickness :
        Active thickness as the average of scour and deposition active thickness [L]
    act_thickness_dep :
        Deposition active thickness (abs(V_sco) + V_dep)/act_area [L]
    act_thickness_sco :
        Scour active thickness (abs(V_sco) + V_dep)/act_area [L]
    bri :
        Bed Relief Index calculated as the standard deviation of the DoD values [L]
