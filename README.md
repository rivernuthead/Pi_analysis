# Pi_analysis repository
Repository that collects all the scripts of the analysis about bedload and morphological activity experiments.

The repository is divided in two parts: the bedload activity analysis and the morphological activity analysis.  
At a certain point the latter takes information from the former to perform the morphological and bedload overlapping.

The repository is structured as following:
1. input folder contains the files that the script needs from the outside. Nothing else.
